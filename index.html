			        <p>I am Professor of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au" target="_new"> Queensland University of Technology</a>. Formerly, I held positions as Australian Research Council Future Fellow (2014-2018), and Australian Research Council Postdoctoral Research Fellow (2006-2009).  In 2024 I am Chair of <a href="https://www.anziam.org.au" target="_new"> ANZIAM</a>, a Division of the <a href="https://austms.org.au/" target="_new"> Australian Mathematical Society </a> whose members are interested in applied mathematics, research in applied mathematics, and tertiary mathematics education. </p>
					
					<p> As Editor-in-Chief of the <a href=https://www.springer.com/journal/11538/ target="_new"> Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, </a> I lead the main publication associated with the <a href=https://www.smb.org/ target="_new"> Society for Mathematical Biology </a>.  The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology is devoted to publishing research at the interface of mathematics and life sciences.  Journal updates are published  <a href=https://www.springer.com/journal/11538/updates target="_new"> here </a>. </p>      
					 	  
				<p>  In 2023 I was a guest on the <a href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-2-mat-simpson/id1693943413?i=1000619193635 target="_new"> Biology in Numbers </a> podcast, where we discussed the future of mathematical biology.  An older 2020 <a href=https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-31-maths-meets-biology target="_new"> Random Sample </a> podcast discusses my pathway into mathematical biology.   QUT's <a href=https://www.qut.edu.au/research/matthew-simpson target="_new"> Research Snapshot </a> summarises the broader aims of my research group. </p>  
					  
				<p>In 2020 I was awarded the <a href="https://www.anziam.org.au/The+2020+EO+Tuck+Medal" target="_new"> EO Tuck </a> model by ANZIAM.  The Tuck medal recognises outstanding research in applied mathematics and distinguished service to the applied mathematics community.  In 2012 I was awarded the <a href="https://www.anziam.org.au/The+2012+JH+Michell+Medal" target="_new"> JH Michell Medal </a> by ANZIAM.  This medal recognises excellence in research in applied mathematics.</p>	  

					  
			        <h3> Research</h3>
		          </header>
			      <p>My early research interests included using continuum mathematical models to interpret in vivo experiments in developmental biology focusing on neural crest cell migration.  More recent projects involved developing stochastic mathematical models of these kinds of in vivo experiments and understanding how to construct approximate continuum limit descriptions of such stochastic models.  More recently, I have been working at the interface of mathematical modelling, uncertainty quantification, parameter estimation and identifiability analysis.  In general, my work involves deploying mathematical tools to understand various biological and biophysical applications that include studying tissue growth on 3D-printed scaffolds, in vitro observations of cell migration and proliferation using fluorescent cell cycle labels, as well as tumour spheroid experiments.</p>
